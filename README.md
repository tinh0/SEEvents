## The Project
SEEvents (pronounced See Events), is a local event notification web-app available on https://seevents.expo.app/. After logging in, users can view local events on a map created by other users. Users can view event details and interact via comments and upvotes. Users can set their notification preferences so that they will be notified of specific event types, allowing quick alerts for the activities they love. Users can also interact with other members by joining communities and making friends, where together they can organize events and foster greater local community involvement.

## Our Story
In the fall semester of 2024, our team came together to discuss and plan ideas for our capstone project. Thien had a fantastic idea to build an app to help service followers of a campus free food social media account that he ran. This account was used by him to alert students at the U of U of free food events occuring on campus, so that they could easily attend them. We took up this idea, and broadened it to include events of all types, and many other features to facilitate community interaction. In a tragic turn of events, Thien fell into a coma after terrible car crash on October 25, 2024 during the planning phase of our project. Kai, Tinh, and Solon have pushed on to develop the idea that Thien had envisioned, and we are deeply saddened that he was not able to be with us on the last leg of this journey.
